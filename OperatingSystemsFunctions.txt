All operating systems must have a file management system. File systems are often organized into directories for easier navigation in order to maximize efficiency. Individual files are stored within these directories, and possibly other directories as well. The operating system keeps track of where files are stored, information about the stored files, and who can access said data.
In a multiple program environment, the OS is capable of managing all open programs. The OS is able to decide what data is processed when and how much processing time is allocated to each one. This function is called "Process Scheduling" and is also able to keep track of the status of each process.
The computer's main or primary memory is also managed by the operating system. The operating system decides what or how much memory to allocate to each program. The OS also tracks the overall memory usage by each application.
